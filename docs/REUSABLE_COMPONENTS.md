# Reusable components

We have some components you can use so you don't have to reivent the wheel. These are some reusable components we have created that you can use in certain parts of the application depending on what you are creating.

Reusable components code can be found at [src/components](../src/components).

Current reusable components:

- CloseButton
- CustomAlert
- Custom Modal
- CustomSnackbar
- LoadingSpinner
- Panel
- ThemeSwitch

## Descriptions of each component:
