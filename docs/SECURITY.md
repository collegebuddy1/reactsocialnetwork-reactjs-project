# Security Policy

If you discover any security issues, do not use the issue tracker.
We take all security bugs seriously.

Thank you for taking the time to help us improve our security by submitting a security issue. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If unsure or unable to get the information from the above, open an issue
in the [Issues](https://github.com/gbowne1/reactsocialnetwork/issues)

To ensure the timely response to your report, please ensure that the entirety
of the report is contained within the email body and not solely behind a web
link or an attachment.

At least one owner will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a
more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, the owners will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
